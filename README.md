## Acknowledgements

- [React Hook Form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) - Very good react forms library with validation included.
- [Stripe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stripe) - Used to handle the payment processing. It has a lot of documentation and examples and was created by the stripe team so its reliable.
- [Card Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/card-validator) - Used to validate the credit card number and expiration date. Simplifies validation of credit cards.

I could have used the following:

- [React Credit Cards](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-credit-cards) - Creates a credit card with animated flip and other interactions.
- [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) - Would probably be a better option for long-term validation but thats really a topic for discussion.
